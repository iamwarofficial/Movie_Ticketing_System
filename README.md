The project was to produce a movie ticketing system using Visual Basic .Net, enabling the user to book a ticket for available movies. Users can check availability for a movie and make a reservation for a specific date and seat. There are three types of seats available: Standard, Gold, and Premium. Customers can select seats depending on personal preference. Each type has its price. Standard is for RM 15, and Gold is for RM 20, and Premium is for RM 45. Regular staff can make new reservations, edit reservations, and enter payments. Only managers can access the reports while the regular staff cannot access the reports.
